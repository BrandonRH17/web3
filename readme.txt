In this repository, I have worked on the following two projects, which involve creating Smart Contracts using the Remix IDE, testing the contract in the .test.js file, deploying the contract, and finally using it with the web3 library and React to display the information in basic front-ends. 

CrowdCoin is a decentralized and transparent competitor to Kickstarter, which has the main problem that whenever the campaign reaches its goal or surpasses it, they just hand out the money to the campaign creator and do not have any control whatsoever about how that money is used. This has led to several scams, project failures, fund mismanagement, etc. leaving funders dissapointed and feeling scammed. 
The solution, powered by Smart Contracts, focuses mainly on creating a request-based money withdrawal system for the campaign creator, so he can only withdraw money by sending out a request to all of the campaign's funders, and the majority of the funders approving said request. He has to specify for what exact purpose the requested money will be used, the recipient's address and the amount he wants to withdraw, so the funders are completely sure that the withdrawal will not be mismanaged or stolen. 


Lottery Simulator is a very basic exercise I did that lets people enter a "lottery" system, where they contribute certain amount of money, and when enough people are entered, the administrator can press a button to select a winner, and the winner automatically gets paid the whole amount. This helped me to get familiarized with the web3 libraries from javascript, as well as the integration to Metamask.
